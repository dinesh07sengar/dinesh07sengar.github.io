          <p>I’ve spent the last several months in Learning at masai, working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, building everything from landing pages to APIs. I also learned how to work as a team and it helped me to do some collaborative projects. Additionally, Learning & building projects at same time isn’t an easy task, however, it has helped me become efficient, productive, and fast even in a very stressful environment, which is an important skill in the tech industry.</p>
